He was very opposed to same-sex marriage (Obergefell v. Hodges was originally Obergefell v. Kasich), he didn\\'t work with Democrats, and he signed an awful Republican gerrymander in 2010. He wasn\\'t by any means bipartisan or moderate.\\n\\nMitch McConnell has been in the Senate for decades. He didn\\'t suddenly get so extreme, he was this bad for quite a while.\\n\\nJohn McCain is another favorite among Democrats. Don\\'t forget, he still voted mostly in line with the GOP. Occasionally he bucked the party line, but not often. He supported Betsy DeVos for secretary of education (which, mind you, was a 50-50 tie. We could\\'ve had a more competent secretary of education if McCain changed his mind). He allowed Republicans to push through extreme supreme court nominees.\\n\\nRepublicans obstructed nearly all of Obama\\'s agenda after 2010. They are no saints. Trump is an extreme manifestation of what the party is, but once he is history, we should not treat him simply as an aberration. The entire party has been rotten for quite some time.',\n",

It reminds me very much of how Confederates and “Lost Cause” Proponents belittle slavery in the reasons for secession. They say state’s rights which slavery could be considered a part of. Or that the war was brought upon by the North. They like to twist the causes to gain sympathy. One group the Daughters of the Confederacy was a proponent of not only statues but history that glorified the CSA and took out the cruelty of slavery. That false history taught generations that still live today, so when Trump became President he fed into falsehoods and subsequently fed Southerners what they wanted to hear. So in 2020 America will decide either Trump who is taking no step to unite America either by fighting Covid or breaking bread with the protestors. Or Joe Biden a man who’s had decades of experience, is willing to accept Progressive measures and policies, will be the transition President to help unite America, who cares for the people’s health, and will not reopen divisions to disunite the people. If Obama lead us from 2009 to 2017 then Trump led us back to 1860.',\n",

       "   'selftext': 'So to start I would now consider myself a moderate democrat and I changed relatively recently from a moderate republican. I changed my party because in my opinion the republicans no longer care about democracy or objective truth, they also seem not to care for free speech unless it’s to protect some of their more heinous ideas. None of what I’m saying is meant to call out republican voters for one simple fact, the Republican Party brainwashes their voters. I know this because I was brainwashed when I was young.\\n\\nBack in 2016 I was still in high school and while I’ve always liked politics (I was in speech and debate) I think I tricked myself into believing I challenged my opinions when in reality I almost never did. I liked republicans because they would fix the National debt, protect individual liberty, and shrink the size of the government. None of which they did, but it didn’t matter at that point because with the family I was born into politics at the dinner table was never about cost benefit analysis it was always “the democrats are ruining this nation” it was always emotional appeal. In fact what often happens is within the party people including my family and me for a time as much as I hate to admit it are encouraged to believe two contradictory statements and both as valid, basically double think from Orwell. A more recent example of this is blaming China for creating a horrible virus while at the same time downplaying that virus and pretending its no worse than the flu.\\n\\nI started about a year ago to re-evaluate all of my positions in politics and get out of the eco chambers I was in. I read more and intentionally sought out people disagreeing with me. And I came to the conclusion that many of my opinions on taxes and government involvement in life were not the best positions to have and I promptly changed them. I then started looking more in depth to the party itself and that’s when I realized how anti-intellectual the Republican Party is. They don’t use facts anymore and really haven’t for a long time, and I have a hard time blaming the base for it due to the rampant brainwashing. When you involve yourself in republican circles your opinions go more and more right because of the social pressures put on you as they care more about winning then being objectively right. I’ll be voting for joe Biden this election as far as I can tell no one is enthusiastic for him and neither am I but it’s the only chance we have of getting rid of trump. I haven’t talked at all about trump in this but to keep it short he is a wannabe dictator and has no business in our democracy/republic. I still believe in individual liberty really above all else just now I’ve realized the party that offers it is not the republicans.',\n",

However, since Trump's interference with the USPS has come to light, I've begun to question whether we should push mail-in voting at this time. We need to make sure that our votes count, and if they're lost in the mail en-mass, then we'll lose the election. So while it's risky to vote in person, I feel as if we should push mail-in voting as a back-up for in-person voting. We want to make sure the disease that is Trump is removed from the White House. If I have to risk one disease to get rid of the bigger disease, I'm willing to do so.\\n\\nAm I alone in thinking this way?\",\n",

are failing to meet their Paris Climate commitments\\n\\n•\\tReverse tax policies that encourage outsourcing\\n\\n•\\tEnd incentives in the Trump tax giveaway that allow multinationals to dramatically

       "   'selftext': \"Hey everyone. My good friend and I just signed up to make volunteer calls for Joe Biden. I'm a progressive Democrat who doesn't love Biden, but I understand the weight of this election and want to do my part in helping vote Trump out of office at all costs. However, I have a few questions--as the signup process wasn't very detailed--and I'm hoping that some of you (maybe those who also volunteer) may know the answers. \\n\\nFirstly, who are we are calling? Are they registered Democrats? Independents? Republicans? People who aren't registered? A mix? And as a follow-up, if these people are not registered, should I have voter registration information on hand for the state in which I'm making calls? \\n\\nSecondly, do the call recipients see your phone number? If so, is there a way to prevent that? \\n\\nThirdly, what's the protocol if people have questions or concerns regarding issues not covered in the provided script? I'm pretty familiar with Joe Biden's platform and stances on issues, however, I'm not an expert on policy and his more nuanced viewpoints. \\n\\nLastly, how should volunteers proceed when a call goes south? In other words, what's the rule of thumb if a recipient doesn't take kindly to a call, and makes rude and obnoxious remarks? \\n\\nThanks in advance for any and all advice! \\n\\nP.S. I have some prior experience with cold calling, and I'm definitely not shy, so I'm not too worried about actually making the calls. I just want to make sure I'm as mentally prepared as possible before doing so. Thanks again! \\n\\nAlso, for anyone else who is interested in signing up:\\n\\n[https://joebiden.com/make-calls-for-joe/](https://joebiden.com/make-calls-for-joe/)\",\n",

But instead, I just live in a country where Democracy is nowhere to be seen.\\n\\nAt this moment in time, in my home country, Thailand, we find ourselves in a regime where our voices are left unheard by the system. Those who espoused Democratic ideals are either harassed to death, or been put to pasture by either the authorities, or the loss of hope.\\n\\nWell, I’m not here to talk about my country. What I’m trying to say is that I’m rooting for y’all to succeed in the upcoming election. I might disagree with what the Democrats are doing to some degree.

But the party needs to think about what they represent and how they can create lasting progressive change. \\n\\nThe past half century has been dominated by conservative politics and failures to address what seem like basic principles in a wealthy, democratic society. The US situations on healthcare, racial and economic inequality, money in politics, and so many other things are just ridiculously bad. \\n\\nThere has been some growing attention to progressive issues. But many in the democratic party seem to favor policies which do not really solve problems on the scale they exist. Futhermore, many are more willing to listen to Mitt Romney supporters than actual solutions on the scale of actual problems. [https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-never-trumpers-crashed-the-democratic-party/](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-never-trumpers-crashed-the-democratic-party/)\\n\\nIn addition to never passing the necessary progressive policy to fix problems, trying to be moderate lets republicans control the political environment. Winning with middle of the road policies is not success if one side gets to choose where the middle is. Let alone losing with middle of the road policies which fail to produce the ideology and excitement of actual change. \\n\\nTrump is not a very good politician (he's consistently but not extremely unpopular) but he is very good at one thing: controlling the political conversation. The 2016 election was a prime example. If we focus on just not being Trump, we may be not overly racist, not climate change deniers, not actively dismantling the ACA, not have a cabinet of billionaires, etc, but we will not be antiracist, act against climate change on the required scale, achieve universal (and affordable to everyone) healthcare, and counter the growing economic inequality of the past half century. \\n\\nWe also might end up with Ivanka Trump (or comparable) as president in 2024: someone who thinks the same things, but speaks with more tact. This would not happen if we make politics about solving problems to help real people on the scale that is necessary.\",\n",

       "   'selftext': '   My whole life I have dreamed of being the President of the United States. Every chance I got, I would debate, I would argue, I would speech-write and contemplate about the biggest issues that our country faced. I would try every time and every place I could to improve my political thought and continue to learn. But now, I have to face the fact that by the time I could really mount a campaign, there would be no America left. \\n\\n       Since the Reagan-Bush years, the economy had been having problems. Problems that were popularized by the Clinton Campaign’s “Its the economy, stupid.” Along with failing health care systems and party fatigue, Bill Clinton rose to office and for 8 years, presided over unprecedented economic growth, with a massive budget surplus by the end of his tenure. But then, George Bush Jr. takes office. In another 8 years, the economy would be tanking in a way that was paralleled only by the Great Depression. Republicans fail, even with the popular and caring John McCain, to beat the young and enigmatic Barack Obama. \\n\\n      For his two terms, President Obama does the unpopular but necessary work to bring the economy back.  And it works - the economy experiences, once again, unprecedented job growth and what could have been a new Great Depression is halted and reversed. And that brings us to 2016 - a sure thing for the Dems, one would think. A stable economy, glad allies, faith in our leadership restored, and more - yet on Election Day, Donald Trump is brought into office. And despite enjoying some economic growth at the start of his term, the Covid-19 pandemic results in an economic crash that, as of the time of writing this, could end out worse than the 08 Recession. Faith in US leadership around the world plummets below even the Bush Jr. years. \\n\\n    So here we are - an unpopular president from a quickly-shrinking party, and if Joe Biden wins in November, he has 8, or perhaps more realistically 4, years to fix all of it. Is it even possible for him to do so? Will our allies ever be able to trust a flip-flopping country that at once wants the best for all of the West and suddenly turns inward and ignores them for years?\\n\\n       I don’t have an answer for it, nor do I have any real words of encouragement. But I can say that I have hope. No matter what may happen come November, we can take some solace in the fact that we weren’t the ones who brought down this country. At least we stood up for Freedom. At least we tried.',\n",

       "   'selftext': 'The great thing about the Black Lives Matter movement is the degree to which the extent of racism in our society has been brought to the attention of more people.  Young people, in particular, have been energized at levels not seen since the Obama campaigns, which of course, waned in the Clinton campaign, and contributed to the rise of Donald Trump. Let’s hope it translates to the ballot box in November.\\n\\nIn 1968, Martin Luther King, Jr. altered his focus, and emphasized income inequality, rather than white-black relations, as the most important all- encompassing issue of social justice.  He created the Poor People’s Campaign.  (I marched in its seminal event on April 26, 1968 in Washington.)  There are those that feel King was assassinated because he altered his focus to an area that was a much greater threat to the powers that be, namely, the pitfalls of American capitalism.\\n\\nThe Black Lives Matter website states:\\n\\n*Four years ago, what is now known as the Black Lives Matter Global Network began to organize. It started out as a chapter-based, member-led organization whose mission was to build local power and to intervene when violence was inflicted on Black communities by the state and vigilantes.*\\n\\n*In the years since, we’ve committed to struggling together and to imagining and creating a world free of anti-Blackness, where every Black person has the social, economic, and political power to thrive.*\\n\\nOf course, the protests we’ve been witnessing have been focused on police racism, and less so, on economic racism.\\n\\nThe Center for Policing Equity at John Jay College of Criminal Justice, CUNY, is one of the few think tanks doing scientific research on police racism.  They have documented this discordance in policing between black and white communities, and have been working with police departments for many years.  Their director, Phillip A. Goff, is an inspiring individual, and his TED talk is worth checking out. \\n\\nFor decades, journalists have been documenting the  racial disparities in the field of health care (to give but one example of another institution’s racism) , resulting in thousands of needless deaths. 600,000 American children have died in the last 50 years from preventable causes, with black children dying at a rate 2-3x higher than white children.  US infant mortality is the highest among Western democracies.  (And our neighbor Cuba puts us to shame in that category.) There are dozens of similar statistics.\\n\\n240 million calls are made to 9-1-1 annually.  What people need to remember is that every single one of those responders is prepared to die for YOU.  Even the monster Derek Chauvin, had been willing to die for every single emergency call he responded to in his career.\\n\\nHow many of you are willing to die for your fellow human beings on a daily basis?\\n\\nRacism is imbued in all our institutions.  The policing system surely has its problems, but if you’re counting deaths at the hands of racism, income inequality and health care disparities are much bigger problems.\\n\\nAs Martin Luther King, Jr. did in 1968, let’s march for the poor.',\n",

I'm not American but I do have a general understanding of American history as it formed part of my history degree. So for instance, I am aware of how parties have shifted stance over time, the history of chattel slavery and plantation life in the US, and I'm aware broadly of debates surrounding States Rights vs Lost Cause narratives of the civil war and commemorations of it. Further, I understand why they are significant at the moment with the removal of confederate monuments and so forth.\\n\\nI was hoping if someone could fill me in on the 'democratic position' (although I know this will vary) in relation to recent events, the current political climate and race relations?\\n\\nAs much as possible I'm looking for answers that are sophisticated and considered, and that explain 'why' where necessary, and give sources for data, figures and quotes if used. I understand that things are very tense over there at the moment but if we could avoid rhetoric, being uncivil and mudslinging, it would be more helpful for my understanding of your position.\\n\\nHope to hear.\",\n",

His predecessor, Rex Tillerson, didn’t have the mental capacity needed. He was dumb as a rock and I couldn’t get rid of him fast enough. He was lazy as hell.

Glad he is gone!\\n\\nDonald J.

His incredible wife, Karen, who I have a lot of respect for, once pulled me aside &amp; said strongly that “John respects you greatly. When we are no longer here, he will only speak well of you.” Wrong!\\n\\nDonald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 13, 2020\\n\\n**Michael Flynn: Former White House National Security Adviser**\\n\\nI had to fire General Flynn because he lied to the Vice President and the FBI. He has pled guilty to those lies. It is a shame because his actions during the transition were lawful. There was nothing to hide!\\n\\nDonald J.

Recused yourself ON DAY ONE (you never told me of a problem), and ran for the hills. You had no courage, &amp; ruined many lives. The dirty cops, &amp; others, got caught by better &amp; stronger people than you. Hopefully this slime will pay a big…\\n\\nDonald J.

Said his wife was driving him crazy, “something big” was happening with her. Getting divorced. He was a mental wreck. We didn’t want him around. Now Fake News puts him on like he was my buddy\\n\\nDonald J.

Good work by General Kelly for quickly firing that dog!\\n\\nDonald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 14, 2018\\n\\n**Alexander Vindman: Former Director for European Affairs for the U.S. National Security Council**\\n\\n….was given a horrendous report by his superior, the man he reported to, who publicly stated that Vindman had problems with judgement, adhering to the chain of command and leaking information. In other words, “OUT”.\\n\\nDonald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 8, 2020\\n\\n**Don McGahn: Former White House Counsel**\\n\\nI was NOT going to fire Bob Mueller, and did not fire Bob Mueller. In fact, he was allowed to finish his Report with unprecedented help from the Trump Administration. Actually, lawyer Don McGahn had a much better chance of being fired than Mueller.

The Bush Administration? Before?\\n\\nHas the news just ramped up their focus on the presidency, or has it always been this....intense? Did the sides switch in the Obama Administration, where FOX was trying to shine a light on the Presidents missteps with facts, and CNN/MSNBC blindly defending him? Same question with the Bush Administration?\\n\\nJust wanted to know what it was like back then, and if what we are witnessing now especially and in these past four years is anything special, or (if Biden wins this year) we can just expect more books, more bombshell interviews, more secret sources speaking out etc etc.\\n\\nThank you!',\n",

I am a PT so i have a very general knowledge of medicine and the human body. My fiance is a RN i find it fascinating how all my friends in the medical  community have dismissed this virus. Aren\\'t these the people you should discuss matters of health. Yes for sane people it is however are slanted left controlled media has decided that it has more knowledge of the situation. Liberals are literally taking the advise of idiots like Nancy Pelosi, Anderson Cooper, Sleepy Joe and who can forget the king himself TOM FUCKING WOLF. I can not believe the overall stupidity of my generation. As a male in his mid 20s its hard to find younger people that think like me. I didnt drink the liberal milkshake that is forced down your throat at college I held strong to my beliefs and ideals. I am honestly so concerned with the future of this country. This libtards actually believe that their cloth mask will protect them from the \"deadliest virus\" in human history. When in reality john hopkins produced a study that said the infection rate of this virus is 10x higher than what is being reported... umm people wake the fuck up that means the death rate is 1/10th of what is being reported. Which means statically speaking you are more likely to die from receiving the influenza vaccine than fucking covid. Sorry Im all over the place I had to rant a little',\n",

HOWEVER, I DO believe Chrissy Teigen IS a child molester and has spent years trying to desensitize people to pedophilia . Whether she’s been doing this subconsciously or intentionally, who really knows. \\n\\nChrissy has been bullying anyone who disagrees w her for YEARS and calling them a white supremacist first off. She is by far the most dangerous, hateful person on Twitters platform. So the fact that she wants to play the victim when it’s her turn to get (justifiably) cancelled, really just proves how much of a delusional narcissist she really is. \\n\\nChrissy threatened to leave twitter because of the “bullying” she’s getting (even though her behavior proves she’s guilty af.) So because of this, Twitter decides to ban anyone affiliated with Qanon. Twitter is a private platform and they have the right to do whatever they want. But they cannot, in good conscience, consider themselves a fair platform as far as I’m concerned. Especially when they antifa , pedophilia , liberal bullying etc run rampant on their site. \\n\\nOnce again, I know the Q crowd is pretty nutty. But what I think twitter is actually attempting to do is silence all republicans. It’s ironic to me, because jack dorsey once said that conservatives who work for him don’t feel comfortable voicing their opinions. \\n\\nhttps://www.google.com/amp/s/thehill.com/policy/technology/406927-twitter-ceo-jack-dorsey-conservative-employees-dont-feel-safe-to-express%3famp\\n\\nI would bet my life that jack has NEVER hired a single conservative. In fact , I know someone who works for twitter (he’s radically left) and even HE grows tired of all liberal bs. Yet, he’s been vocally supportive of this decision. Just as colleges and universities have become leftist indoctrination camps, it seems tech companies have inevitably been met with the same fate. Companies like Facebook and Twitter have been censoring republicans for YEARS. How much further will this go? Share your thoughts.',\n",

As an American I know I am biased but looking at it as objectively as I can; we’re the most prosperous nation that’s ever existed. The US has provided more opportunity to more people than any other nation in history which is why tens of millions of people have immigrated here and millions continue to try and do so. We’re the most influential country on earth. Look at the news cycle while in Europe or another part of the world, everyone pays attention to what happens here. Everyone listens to American music and American movies. The American military’s presence throughout the world has provided what you could call a second Pax Romana. We’re the most charitable nation. I could keep going but I think you get the picture. The reason why I’m writing this is a post on the front page of reddit showing how the US is one of the worst places to raise a family. The people that do these studies simply cherry pick statistics.',\n",

I typed this on my phone for a bit so please at least just read it.\\n\\nWe live in a once great nation where we served our God and country (I\\'m not trying to discredit other religions) and we had true love for what this nation stands for. Now the government reaches to far into our day to day lives \\nDid you know that it\\'s easier for an 11 year old to watch hardcore pornography online then it is to have a legal lemonade stand. \\n\\nCan you name a win for us in the past few years? Cause we have failed on gun policy, immigration policy, abortion policy and healthcare policy.\\n\\nNow what have we done successfully? Well we beat Marxism when the USSR fell but we still have it today and \\n(dumb) people still want it around. That\\'s the biggest thing we have accomplished. \\n\\nNow I realise the left hates America and that\\'s why they want to change it. They want to kill children. They want to sexualize the children that make it out of the womb too. Now not to mention that almost everything they want will cause the destruction of the United States of America as we know it. Everything they want is either immoral or had been proven impossible. \\n\\nThey want to take away our gun rights and our rights to religion and freedom of speech. People want to take away our gun rights first so we can\\'t fight back when they take the rest of them. Now not to mention that the school systems that are teaching todays youth are teaching them that guns are bad and healthcare should be universal and that life doesn\\'t really start in the womb and that it\\'s just a clump of cells and this isn\\'t just some statistic... I know because I\\'m there everyday and when I speak out for what\\'s right i get a lowered grade. Hell I was sick for 2 weeks and my liberal teacher kicked me out of her class because there was \"too much to catch up on\" even though the only thing they did was watch the popular medical drama \"House M.D\"\\n\\nNow we need to speak up for what\\'s right now if you want to help then watch John Doyle on YouTube I will link you to a good video of his. Now after you watch this look at the second part. I hope you all have a wonderful day and good bless!\\n\\nLink: https://youtu.be/uKjVBsqX7LU',\n",

That would be grouping people, which is what we are supposed to be fighting, right? Well the only grouping I see is being done by people that seem to want to \\'solve the problem\\' the most.\\n\\nWe fell for it. The media, owned by the elite powers that be, are simply telling us to keep fighting instead of joining hands together and improving impoverished communities and helping broken families and failing public schools.\\n\\nIt is so sad how the masses are turned into sheep by mass media and political parties.\\n\\nSigned\\n- independent',\n",

       "   'selftext': 'Liberal immigrant: USA is great\\n\\nAmerica is a pretty great place to live\\n\\nI am as left as they come.  I protested with BLM. I vote blue down the line. I strive for equality. \\n\\n\\nThroughout the last few weeks I have seem\\nturmoil in the place I was born; Cops killing minorities, COVID taking whoever it wants, riots that get out of hand. \\n\\nHowever, (here it comes)\\n\\nMy family immigrated here about 40 years ago. In our country, my family was nothing. We couldn’t get any help. A decent public education was unheard of. Fire brigades don’t exist. My parents saved everything they had and  immigrated to USA legally. Since then my parents were able to work hard and eventually open 3 stores in my town. I was able to go to college. Now I am working at a company that pays me well. I have a wife and a child on the way! I own a house and even have 2 pets. \\n\\nI can’t imagine my life if my parents didn’t move to USA. I love my heritage in Iran, but I feel like my parents made the right decision.\\n\\nIt hurts my heart to see the party I support disparage the country just because the person in office is trump. It seems that people here want to tear down the foundation of this country. The foundation that my parents left there families for, just so I could have a better life in a free country. \\n\\nI hate racist cops, but at least we have cops who\\ndont take bribes. At least we have cops. My parents tell me stories of times where criminals would\\nthreaten them and the only recourse was to hide and wait. \\n\\nI hate confederate statues, but tearing down George Washingtons, Abraham Lincoln doesn’t make sense to me. They were the ones to make this land free for all? I recently found that some foundation fathers had slaves. We all condemn that, but we all have sins. If we can only make statue of sinless person, then there won’t be statues. \\n\\nI am all for change, I want to end police brutality. But please don’t try to rip up the foundation of this country. I am here, and I want future people like me\\nto experience it as well. I want my son to see why his grandparents sacrificed so much so he could\\nLive here. \\n\\nI understand this is going against Reddit and my left friends, but I feel like I need this to be heard. Thank you.',\n",

They also told me that left wing figures such as Kamela Harris are left but not far left candidates. Do you believe this to be true?

       "   'selftext': 'I think the president had been too much on the \"self-defense\" mode in the past few months. He spent a great deal of time during his various speeches telling us what he achieved in the past 3 years, and over and over again how it was all destroyed by the Plague. He even spent some 20 min in Tulsa to entertain how he had no issue holding a cup and walking down a ramp. I think while it\\'s good to clarify things, moving forward we the voters need to hear what he has planned for the next 4 years if he was re-elected.\\n\\nIf I was his campaign manager I would first tell the public what \\\\*\\\\*legacy\\\\*\\\\* was achieved in the last term despite the Plague. For example, the empowerment of the conservative - how 4 years ago being conservative was always ridiculed and people shied from expressing conservative ideas, but now we have bigger voice on the media like Tucker Carlson, we have our own social media Parler, we are no longer afraid of being politically incorrect. Also, how we were able to get rid of external terrorist threat and how it enables us to focus on domestic issues. Don\\'t just boast - tell the implications for our future.\\n\\nAnd then, it\\'s high time for the president to lay out exactly what he plan to achieve in the next 4 years. For example, if he really wants to stop China from being our threat, how will he do that? How will he address and fix the racial tension? How will he continue to improve healthcare for vulnerable people? How will he help America live with the COVID? How will he take the advantage of low interest rates and spend money on infrastructures, something he promised to do earlier this year but details would be great.\\n\\nBasically, you see Biden and his supporters are trying to induce hate for the president, saying Trump is the cause of all problems etc., and they do that because they have nothing to show. He didn\\'t achieve anything and they have no plans. Biden becoming the president makes him not an actual leader but just a symbol of leftism, for those who would vote for him just to have him in office and do nothing. So the president needs to show to the people that he\\'s not gonna just be a symbol for the conservatives, but he will actually implement what he believes in.',\n",

People who are at a higher risk for disease and subsequent death drive me to help by wearing my mask. Even if it doesn't help a bit (which, they do seem to immensely help, according to most evidence). This has nothing to do with Trump and everything to do with decency. I just want people to be safe, and the best way to do that is to be considerate and cautious for even just a little bit. This is not something we have dealt with before now, and there is so much we don't understand, but I don't think this has to be political.

       "   'selftext': \"A little bit about myself. I came to the US about 6 years ago from a wealthy middle eastern country as an international student. In the place where I come from ( super muslim community,)  I'm considered to be very liberal. \\n\\nMy first in person exposure to US politics, came through a major liberal university campus where you'd considered evil if you identify republican. I got to witness the insane meltdown people went through when Trump got elected in 2016. I remember my gf at the time crying while she's telling me I'm going to get deported.  Now obviously, that didn't happen. \\n\\nDue to my background and skin color, everybody around me assumed I was liberal. Because I considered myself to be liberal in middle eastern standards I kinda went along with that too. It wasn't until recently that I started questioning that notion. \\n\\nI find that most of my ethical and economic beliefs are conservative. The only thing that I don't quite get is why conservatives support smaller goverments. \\n\\nAlmost every thing I can find online is either baised or too complicated for me to understand.  \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nCan someone please explain this to me ?\",\n",

Yes we do pay relatively high taxes and there is probably more regulation that would actually be efficient.\\n\\nOn the other hand, we don’t need to pay jack shit for healthcare, no need to worry about health insurance or that losing a job or having to have surgery or to call an ambulance would bankrupt us. And no I don’t wait for months or even weeks to see a doctor with an urgent matter, if I tell that my matter is urgent then I get to the doctor the next day at the latest.\\n\\nYet, the society is free, and the economy is capitalist.\\n\\nWe do have gun control, but that’s just to have sufficient background checks and to register who all has weapons. It’s not hard to pass, my country has probably the highest rate of firearms per capita in Europe. We hunt a lot. But there’s very little gun violence.\\n\\nSo I guess my question is, why are leftist politics basically painted as some monster fascist control system? I don’t mean every country should run like mine does, that’s fine and different systems have different strong points. \\n\\nBut don’t you think there would be some good to come out of just, you know, tipping your pinky toe into socialism from time to time? Not a lot, just a little. Just so that the society would have a basic safety net for people who fall into some hard times.',\n",

       "   'selftext': 'I saw a video of a black man recording and giving away a white woman’s address because she called him the n word, the video received lots of positive attention and he even made money off of it by selling t shirts with quotes from the encounter. What the woman did was inexcusable, but the fact that he gave away her address and people online are supporting and encouraging such behavior, is also inexcusable imo. He followed her to her house and she was crying, because she thought her life was ruined and it pretty much is when it’s all over the news, she probably lost her job and now people know where she lives and this is encouraged by the news, by social media and by BLM supporters. It’s just wrong, it reminds me of back in the day if a white man followed a black man to his home because he called him a cracker, then his life would most likely be ended, but I believe there’s something reminiscent of that happening rn and because it’s happening to white people, no one really dares to speak out against it or else they’ll be deemed racist by the racist liberals',\n",

Almost every headline focuses on reddit banning The_Donald for \"hate speech violations.\"\\n\\nChapotraphouse, which was full of leftist calls to violence is mentioned as an afterthought if at all.\\n\\nAnd The Donald has been dead for MONTHS.  The admins killed it and they moved to another site.  No one has been posting there.\\n\\nBut they wanted a headline saying that they had banned it for hate.\\n\\nThat\\'s bullshit.  They didn\\'t ban it for hate.  The banned it because they wanted that headline right now.\\n\\nThey banned Chapo so they\\'d have cover to say this was unbiased.\\n\\nBut the actual BIG STORY is that reddit is biased now.\\n\\nAs you read these words from Spez I want you to remember:\\n\\n\"All animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others.\"\\n\\nSpez: \"While the rule on hate protects such groups, it does not protect all groups or all forms of identity. For example, the rule does not protect groups of people who are in the majority or who promote such attacks of hate.\"\\n\\nOne of the protected groups is illegal immigrants.\\n\\nBut apparently, if you are in a \"majority\" group... it\\'s fine on reddit for people to say that you are subhuman scum.  Hate against YOU is not actionable.\\n\\nWhat a lovely free-speech place!\\n\\nAnd reddit wasn\\'t transparent in the subreddits that I banned.  You got to know what a FEW of them were (including **The_Donald natch because they wanted THAT headline**_\\n\\nBut r/hatecrimehoaxes is gone.  So is r/campusconservatives?  For some reason?

If they manage to take it down, r/republican will be next...\\n\\nThe reign of terror see... it doesn\\'t ever stop.\\n\\nThat\\'s why you should never START it.\\n\\nPersonally, I think that this is the beginning of the end of reddit.  And it\\'s been fun.  I mean...it\\'s also been crap for conservatives and especially mods who have been targeted for harassment by the lefty hordes.\\n\\nBut that\\'s gonna be fine now.  Because they will say that we are in the majority...so we aren\\'t protected from hate the way everyone else is protected from hate.\\n\\nThis was a scam.',\n",

In the scene, Stiller\\'s Zoolander and Wilson\\'s Hansel go undercover to steal computer files as black and Hispanic janitors. For the initial part of the scene, different actors, one black and one Hispanic, portray Derek and Hansel, with the main characters\\' voices dubbed over. Off screen the makeup is removed and Stiller and Wilson comeback as themselves with dark makeup covering all of their bodies EXCEPT their actual faces. Even around their faces is darkened with makeup. I wonder if Stiller knew what he was doing, and used a loophole of darkening with makeup everything but his face so he could say, \"well, I didn\\'t actually use \\'blackface.\\'\" \\n\\nHere is a link to the end of the full scene, with the makeup providing their disguises removed.

That way you are able to increase taxes, and this will produce more poverty.\\n4) Gun Control - Remove the ability to defend themselves from the government . That way you are able to create a police state.\\n5) Welfare - Take control of every aspect (food, housing, income) of their lives because that will make them fully dependent on the government.\\n6) Education - Take control of what people read, listen to and take control of what children learn in school.\\n7) Religion - Remove the belief in God from the government and schools because the people need to believe in ONLY the government knowing what is best for the people.\\n8)Class Warfare - Divide the people into the wealthy and the poor. Eliminate the middle class. This will cause more discontent and it will be easier to tax the rich with the support of the poor.\\n\\nSound familiar? \\nWE ARE THERE!\\nWhy can\\'t people see what\\'s going on in this country? \\nAre people really that blind?',\n",

       "   'selftext': 'First I want to say I\\'m neither Republican nor Democrat. I hang out on this sub because I feel inundated by biased, liberal media and I want to hear the other side. I\\'m thoroughly disturbed by the liberal media\\'s sustained attack against Trump and the liberals\\' unquestioning belief in their moral superiority, when the facts to me show that the Democratic party has no interest in helping the poor. \\n\\nThe facts are that Bill Clinton, a Democrat, destroyed welfare as we knew it (TANF). He also ratified NAFTA which I consider one of the worst things to happen to working class America, period, though a lot of Americans don\\'t seem to understand this. What did Obama do in his 8 years of presidency for the poor or black populations? He bailed out the banks and gifted health insurance companies with huge taxpayer subsidies and allowed premium hikes. His \"police reform\" took the form of 1-8 *hour* \"bias training\" classes that police departments could opt to take every *year* *or every 10 years**.* What? He drastically increased the number of H-1B visas which has the effect of forcing down middle class employees\\' wages through competition. In the 2008 financial crisis Americans received stimulus packages of, at most, $300 per adult. Yet under Trump we received $1200 per adult plus an additional $500 per child, and he gets nothing but contempt for not authorizing more. Trump also doubled the childcare tax credit, but somehow the media managed to drag that through the mud. I could go on and on, but I have no idea how the liberal media has so thoroughly managed to hoodwink Democrats into thinking their party represents the poor.  \\n\\n\\nBack to my original point, if anyone has read this far, is you can tell what party a small town is for just by how rundown it looks (and this is just my observation, not fact). I\\'ve driven all over the country, and no matter where I go, almost invariably, if it\\'s a well-kept, wealthy looking little town you will see Democrat bumper stickers. And if it\\'s a dump of a town where the people have obviously been forgotten, you see Republican bumper stickers and signs to \"vote\" everywhere. No wonder. Poor populations seem to be smart enough to understand that the Democrats just do not have their back.',\n",
