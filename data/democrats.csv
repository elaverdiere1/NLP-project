And I'm sorry, but this just isn't true.

Let's look at John Kasich. He was very opposed to same-sex marriage (Obergefell v. Hodges was originally Obergefell v. Kasich), he didn't work with Democrats, and he signed an awful Republican gerrymander in 2010. He wasn't by any means bipartisan or moderate.

Mitch McConnell has been in the Senate for decades. He didn't suddenly get so extreme, he was this bad for quite a while.

John McCain is another favorite among Democrats. Don't forget, he still voted mostly in line with the GOP. Occasionally he bucked the party line, but not often. He supported Betsy DeVos for secretary of education (which, mind you, was a 50-50 tie. We could've had a more competent secretary of education if McCain changed his mind). He allowed Republicans to push through extreme supreme court nominees.

Republicans obstructed nearly all of Obama's agenda after 2010. They are no saints. Trump is an extreme manifestation of what the party is, but once he is history, we should not treat him simply as an aberration. The entire party has been rotten for quite some time.",democrats,Can we please stop looking at pre-Trump Republicans with rose tinted glasses?

It reminds me very much of how Confederates and ‚ÄúLost Cause‚Äù Proponents belittle slavery in the reasons for secession. They say state‚Äôs rights which slavery could be considered a part of. Or that the war was brought upon by the North. They like to twist the causes to gain sympathy. One group the Daughters of the Confederacy was a proponent of not only statues but history that glorified the CSA and took out the cruelty of slavery. That false history taught generations that still live today, so when Trump became President he fed into falsehoods and subsequently fed Southerners what they wanted to hear. So in 2020 America will decide either Trump who is taking no step to unite America either by fighting Covid or breaking bread with the protestors. Or Joe Biden a man who‚Äôs had decades of experience, is willing to accept Progressive measures and policies, will be the transition President to help unite America, who cares for the people‚Äôs health, and will not reopen divisions to disunite the people.

1595200592,"So to start I would now consider myself a moderate democrat and I changed relatively recently from a moderate republican. I changed my party because in my opinion the republicans no longer care about democracy or objective truth, they also seem not to care for free speech unless it‚Äôs to protect some of their more heinous ideas. None of what I‚Äôm saying is meant to call out republican voters for one simple fact, the Republican Party brainwashes their voters. I know this because I was brainwashed when I was young.

Back in 2016 I was still in high school and while I‚Äôve always liked politics (I was in speech and debate) I think I tricked myself into believing I challenged my opinions when in reality I almost never did. I liked republicans because they would fix the National debt, protect individual liberty, and shrink the size of the government. None of which they did, but it didn‚Äôt matter at that point because with the family I was born into politics at the dinner table was never about cost benefit analysis it was always ‚Äúthe democrats are ruining this nation‚Äù it was always emotional appeal. In fact what often happens is within the party people including my family and me for a time as much as I hate to admit it are encouraged to believe two contradictory statements and both as valid, basically double think from Orwell. A more recent example of this is blaming China for creating a horrible virus while at the same time downplaying that virus and pretending its no worse than the flu.

I started about a year ago to re-evaluate all of my positions in politics and get out of the eco chambers I was in. I read more and intentionally sought out people disagreeing with me. And I came to the conclusion that many of my opinions on taxes and government involvement in life were not the best positions to have and I promptly changed them. I then started looking more in depth to the party itself and that‚Äôs when I realized how anti-intellectual the Republican Party is. They don‚Äôt use facts anymore and really haven‚Äôt for a long time, and I have a hard time blaming the base for it due to the rampant brainwashing. When you involve yourself in republican circles your opinions go more and more right because of the social pressures put on you as they care more about winning then being objectively right. I‚Äôll be voting for joe Biden this election as far as I can tell no one is enthusiastic for him and neither am I but it‚Äôs the only chance we have of getting rid of trump. I haven‚Äôt talked at all about trump in this but to keep it short he is a wannabe dictator and has no business in our democracy/republic. I still believe in individual liberty really above all else just now I‚Äôve realized the party that offers it is not the republicans.",democrats,My experience with the right.

He and I both hate Fidel Castro. We loved his policies for free healthcare and education, but there is absolutely no excuse for murdering innocent people ain‚Äôt for disagreeing (bear in mind Fidel was very petty). 

My dad came to the US along with other Cuban exiles when Castro came in power back in the ‚Äò50s. My old man was born in 1950, my grandmother who has passed a long time ago, brought him here because my grandfather volunteer for my dad to leave if he were to suffer in a camp. I loved my grandfather for this.

The reason why Cubans vote Republican is because they fear Democrats are like Fidel. In the ‚Äò90s, when I was born in 1991, my parents were conservative and taught me how bad Democrats were (Bear in mind, were all now Democrats but hear me out).

So as the ‚Äò90s and ‚Äò00s have gone by, in 2015, my father completely disapproved Trump, he told me
to vote for Hillary. This year, he wants me to vote for Biden. He told me ‚ÄúSon, I‚Äôm sorry for filling your head that Democrats are bad. You‚Äôre right, Republicans are ruining this country intentionally.‚Äù

#ENSURING THE FUTURE IS MADE IN AMERICA, BY AMERICANS


Joe spoke to America yesterday and laid a bold new vision to ensure the future will be made in America, by Americans. 

* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13VAvHV9Fks

**Here are the many highlights of that plan:**



---------------


‚Ä¢	 $400 billion Procurement Investment in clean energy and infrastructure plan to power new demand for American products, materials, and services and ensuring shipping on U.S.-flagged cargo carriers

‚Ä¢	Retool and Revitalize American Manufacturers, with a focus on smaller manufacturers through incentives, additional resources, and new financing tools

‚Ä¢	$300 Billion Investment in Research and Development (R&amp;D) and Breakthrough Technologies, including electric vehicle technology, lightweight materials to 5G and artificial intelligence 

‚Ä¢	Ensure investments reach all of America and not limited by race, zip code, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, disability, religion or national origin

‚Ä¢	Pursue Pro-American Worker Tax and Trade Strategy to fix harmful policies of Trump Administration to give manufacturers and workers the fair shot they need to compete for jobs and market share

‚Ä¢	Bring back critical Supply Chains to America to eliminate dependency on China or other countries for critical goods in a crisis

‚Ä¢	Create 5 million new jobs in manufacturing and innovation

‚Ä¢	Use government‚Äôs purchasing power to buy American, boosting U.S. industries through historic procurement

‚Ä¢	Tighten domestic content rules

‚Ä¢	Eliminate loopholes which allow products to be stamped ‚ÄúMade in America‚Äù 

‚Ä¢	Close loophole currently allowing procurement officers within federal Agencies yo waive buy American rules without explanation or scrutiny 

‚Ä¢	End false advertising from companies that label products as Made in America even if they‚Äôre coming from China or elsewhere

‚Ä¢	Require all steel, iron, and manufactured products used in transportation projects are melted, mined, and manufactured in the U.S.

‚Ä¢	Work with allies to modernize international trade rules and associated domestic regulations regarding government procurement, making sure U.S. and allies use their own taxpayer dollars to spur investment in their own countries

‚Ä¢	Take steps to ensure American cargo is carried on U.S.-flag ships, leading to additional demand for American-made ships and U.S. merchant mariners

----------------------

#HISTORIC PROCUREMENT INVESTMENT

‚Ä¢	Purchasing tens of billions of dollars of clean vehicles and products and ensure other countries will be buying the next generation of battery technology and electric vehicles manufactured by American workers

‚Ä¢	Commit to purchasing American steel, cement, concrete, other building materials, and equipment, and in the process not only help rebuild our crumbling infrastructure and retrofit our buildings, but position our domestic companies to lead in resilient, sustainable production for the future

‚Ä¢	Purchase critical medical supplies and pharmaceuticals, ensuring sufficient stockpiles to weather any crisis so  Americans get best possible care

‚Ä¢	Commit future purchases in advanced industries like cutting-edge telecommunications and artificial intelligence to only creating new, lasting American jobs and protecting our intellectual property and national security

‚Ä¢	Require companies receiving procurement contracts, provide paid leave, fair overtime  scheduling, pay at least $15 per hour and guarantee choice to join a union and bargain collectively

‚Ä¢	Support small businesses including those owned by women and people of color

‚Ä¢	Ensuring at least 23% of federal contracts get awarded to small businesses

------------------


#RETOOL &amp; REVITALIZE

‚Ä¢	Provide capital for small to medium manufacturers to invest and compete

‚Ä¢	Establish credit facility to supply capital, especially to smaller manufacturers, so aging factories can modernize, compete, and reduce carbon

‚Ä¢	Quadruple Manufacturing Extension Partnership to help America‚Äôs small and medium-sized manufacturers compete for **Buy American** contracts and modernize (Trump tried to eliminate this program - Biden will quadruple it)

‚Ä¢	Provide manufacturing tax credit to Retool and Revitalize

‚Ä¢	Projects receiving credit will have to benefit local workers and communities, meeting strong labor standards, including paying workers a prevailing wage, employing workers trained in registered apprenticeship programs

‚Ä¢	Expand Manufacturing Innovation partnerships


--------------------

#FEDERALLY FUNDED RESEARCH &amp; DEVELOPMENT 

‚Ä¢	Accelerated Research &amp; Development investment of $300 billion over 4 years to create millions of good jobs and to secure our global leadership in the most critical and competitive new industries and technologies

‚Ä¢	Major increases in federal R&amp;D spending, including new National Institutes of Health, National Science Foundation, Department of Energy, Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health (ARPA-H), Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), and other peer-reviewed science research grants to colleges and universities

‚Ä¢	Investments in breakthrough technology R&amp;D programs including 5G, artificial intelligence, advanced materials, biotechnology, and clean vehicles

‚Ä¢	Competitive capital financing to encourage small businesses to commercialize cutting-edge technology, such as a scaled-up version of the Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) program, ‚ÄúAmerica‚Äôs seed fund,‚Äù which provides capital to small businesses pursuing R&amp;D commercialization in concert with research institutions

‚Ä¢	Funds for creation or expansion of technical training programs around digital, statistical, and technology skills, funded by the Labor Department

‚Ä¢	Infrastructure for educational institutions and partners to expand research

‚Ä¢	Ensure technological change benefits workers, creates jobs, and strengthens the middle class

‚Ä¢	Ensure U.S. government captures a share of the royalties of high-profitable products developed with federal R&amp;D funding

‚Ä¢	Give workers a voice in innovation and are first in line to benefit


-------------------


#USE FULL U.S. TALENTS &amp; INVEST IN COMMUNITIES AND WORKERS 

The economic opportunities from investment in innovation are not being shared throughout the U.S. - 25% percent of venture capital investment is concentrated in the San Francisco area, and 75% flows to just three states: California, New York, and Massachusetts. There are a significant number of diverse communities across every region of the country which can become new centers of job-creating innovation and production. 

‚Ä¢	Direct new federal investments to more than 50 communities across our nation that have the capabilities but have too often been overlooked

‚Ä¢	Creating at least 200 new centers serving as research incubators and connect students underrepresented in fields critical to our nation‚Äôs future

‚Ä¢	Dedicating additional and increased priority funding streams at federal agencies for grants and contracts for HBCUs and MSIs

‚Ä¢	Requiring any federal research grants to universities with an endowment of over $1 billion to form a meaningful partnership and enter into a 10% minimum subcontract with an HBCU, TCU, or MSI

‚Ä¢	Require competitive grant programs give similar universities opportunities to compete against each other, for example, ensuring that HBCUs only compete against HBCUs

----------------


#JOB &amp; EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITY

‚Ä¢	Career and technical education for high school students

‚Ä¢	Free high-quality training programs

‚Ä¢	Free community college and free tuition for 4-year degrees for families earning less than $125,000

‚Ä¢	Invest $50 billion in high-quality training programs that give workers a chance to earn an industry-recognized credential without debt

‚Ä¢	Create and expand community college-business-union partnerships to develop effective training programs

‚Ä¢	Scale up work-based learning programs with a focus on building a diverse workforce, through opportunities like registered apprenticeships, pre-apprenticeship, and other labor-management training programs

‚Ä¢	Work with unions to bring forward a new generation of registered apprenticeships in fields ranging from technology to manufacturing to care work, allowing workers who have lost their jobs during the pandemic to train for jobs of the future while earning a decent income

‚Ä¢	Help develop pathways for diverse workers to access training and career opportunities

‚Ä¢	**Extend unemployment Insurance benefits** for the duration of training, up-skilling, and reskilling programs while unemployment rates are elevated

‚Ä¢	Invest $70 billion in Historically Black Colleges and Universities, Tribal Colleges and Universities, and Minority-Serving Institutions

‚Ä¢	Invest $35 billion in HBCUs, TCUs, and MSIs to create research centers of excellence, build high-tech labs and other facilities, and strengthen graduate programs in fields including STEM

‚Ä¢	Tackle workplace discrimination and harassment keeping so many women, especially women of color, from earning equal pay or fully realizing their professional goals


------------------


#PRO-AMERICAN-WORKER TAX AND TRADE STRATEGY

‚Ä¢	Take aggressive trade enforcement actions against China or any other country seeking to undercut American manufacturing through unfair practices, including currency manipulation, anti-competitive dumping, state-owned company abuses, or unfair subsidies

‚Ä¢	Coordinated effort to pressure the Chinese government and other trade abusers to follow the rules and hold them to account when they do not

‚Ä¢	Confront foreign efforts to steal American intellectual property

‚Ä¢	Address state-sponsored cyber espionage against American companies

‚Ä¢	Set forth clear demands and specific consequences if China‚Äôs government does not cease cyber espionage

‚Ä¢	Develop new sanctions authorities against Chinese firms which steal U.S. technology,which will cut them off from accessing the U.S. market and financial system

‚Ä¢	Establish a ‚Äúclaw-back‚Äù provision to force a company to return public investments and tax benefits when they close down jobs here and send them overseas

‚Ä¢	Apply carbon adjustment fee against countries who are failing to meet their Paris Climate commitments

‚Ä¢	Reverse tax policies that encourage outsourcing

‚Ä¢	End incentives in the Trump tax giveaway that allow multinationals to dramatically lower taxes on income earned overseas and allow the largest, most profitable companies to pay no tax at all

‚Ä¢	Confront global tax secrecy and avoidance, taking on individuals and businesses that stash their profits in tax havens to avoid paying their fair share

‚Ä¢	Tighten anti-inversion rules that Obama-Biden put in place and which Trump has sought to weaken

‚Ä¢	Support strong and independent trade unions here in the United States and in every one of our trading partners

‚Ä¢	Enforce existing labor provisions and aggressively push for strong and enforceable labor provisions in any trade deal his administration

------------------

#BRING BACK CRITICAL SUPPLY CHAINS

‚Ä¢	Never again face shortages of critical products such as medical equipment when confronting a national crisis.

‚Ä¢	Put Americans to work making critical products, from medical equipment and supplies to semiconductors and communications technology, here in the United States

‚Ä¢	Close critical U.S. supply chain gaps by immediately directing a comprehensive and ongoing process to evaluate and protect key U.S. supply chains, starting in the first  

‚Ä¢	Leverage federal buying, including the Defense Production Act, BARDA, and federal procurement, to make sure that we make critical products in America

‚Ä¢	Change the tax code to eliminate the incentives for pharmaceutical and other companies to move production overseas and establish new incentives for companies to make critical products in the U.S

‚Ä¢	Rebuild critical stockpiles, ensure adequate surge manufacturing capacity in times of crisis, and regularly review supply chain vulnerabilities

‚Ä¢	Work with allies to reduce their dependence on competitors like China while modernizing international trade rules to secure U.S. and allied supply chains

#ENSURING THE FUTURE IS MADE IN AMERICA, BY AMERICANS


Joe spoke to America yesterday and laid a bold new vision to ensure the future will be made in America, by Americans. 

* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13VAvHV9Fks

**Here are the many highlights of that plan:**



---------------


‚Ä¢	 $400 billion Procurement Investment in clean energy and infrastructure plan to power new demand for American products, materials, and services and ensuring shipping on U.S.-flagged cargo carriers

‚Ä¢	Retool and Revitalize American Manufacturers, with a focus on smaller manufacturers through incentives, additional resources, and new financing tools

‚Ä¢	$300 Billion Investment in Research and Development (R&amp;D) and Breakthrough Technologies, including electric vehicle technology, lightweight materials to 5G and artificial intelligence 

‚Ä¢	Ensure investments reach all of America and not limited by race, zip code, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, disability, religion or national origin

‚Ä¢	Pursue Pro-American Worker Tax and Trade Strategy to fix harmful policies of Trump Administration to give manufacturers and workers the fair shot they need to compete for jobs and market share

‚Ä¢	Bring back critical Supply Chains to America to eliminate dependency on China or other countries for critical goods in a crisis

‚Ä¢	Create 5 million new jobs in manufacturing and innovation

‚Ä¢	Use government‚Äôs purchasing power to buy American, boosting U.S. industries through historic procurement

‚Ä¢	Tighten domestic content rules

‚Ä¢	Eliminate loopholes which allow products to be stamped ‚ÄúMade in America‚Äù 

‚Ä¢	Close loophole currently allowing procurement officers within federal Agencies yo waive buy American rules without explanation or scrutiny 

‚Ä¢	End false advertising from companies that label products as Made in America even if they‚Äôre coming from China or elsewhere

‚Ä¢	Require all steel, iron, and manufactured products used in transportation projects are melted, mined, and manufactured in the U.S.

‚Ä¢	Work with allies to modernize international trade rules and associated domestic regulations regarding government procurement, making sure U.S. and allies use their own taxpayer dollars to spur investment in their own countries

‚Ä¢	Take steps to ensure American cargo is carried on U.S.-flag ships, leading to additional demand for American-made ships and U.S. merchant mariners

----------------------

#HISTORIC PROCUREMENT INVESTMENT

‚Ä¢	Purchasing tens of billions of dollars of clean vehicles and products and ensure other countries will be buying the next generation of battery technology and electric vehicles manufactured by American workers

‚Ä¢	Commit to purchasing American steel, cement, concrete, other building materials, and equipment, and in the process not only help rebuild our crumbling infrastructure and retrofit our buildings, but position our domestic companies to lead in resilient, sustainable production for the future

‚Ä¢	Purchase critical medical supplies and pharmaceuticals, ensuring sufficient stockpiles to weather any crisis so  Americans get best possible care

‚Ä¢	Commit future purchases in advanced industries like cutting-edge telecommunications and artificial intelligence to only creating new, lasting American jobs and protecting our intellectual property and national security

‚Ä¢	Require companies receiving procurement contracts, provide paid leave, fair overtime  scheduling, pay at least $15 per hour and guarantee choice to join a union and bargain collectively

‚Ä¢	Support small businesses including those owned by women and people of color

‚Ä¢	Ensuring at least 23% of federal contracts get awarded to small businesses

------------------


#RETOOL &amp; REVITALIZE

‚Ä¢	Provide capital for small to medium manufacturers to invest and compete

‚Ä¢	Establish credit facility to supply capital, especially to smaller manufacturers, so aging factories can modernize, compete, and reduce carbon

‚Ä¢	Quadruple Manufacturing Extension Partnership to help America‚Äôs small and medium-sized manufacturers compete for **Buy American** contracts and modernize (Trump tried to eliminate this program - Biden will quadruple it)

‚Ä¢	Provide manufacturing tax credit to Retool and Revitalize

‚Ä¢	Projects receiving credit will have to benefit local workers and communities, meeting strong labor standards, including paying workers a prevailing wage, employing workers trained in registered apprenticeship programs

‚Ä¢	Expand Manufacturing Innovation partnerships


--------------------

#FEDERALLY FUNDED RESEARCH &amp; DEVELOPMENT 

‚Ä¢	Accelerated Research &amp; Development investment of $300 billion over 4 years to create millions of good jobs and to secure our global leadership in the most critical and competitive new industries and technologies

‚Ä¢	Major increases in federal R&amp;D spending, including new National Institutes of Health, National Science Foundation, Department of Energy, Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health (ARPA-H), Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), and other peer-reviewed science research grants to colleges and universities

‚Ä¢	Investments in breakthrough technology R&amp;D programs including 5G, artificial intelligence, advanced materials, biotechnology, and clean vehicles

‚Ä¢	Competitive capital financing to encourage small businesses to commercialize cutting-edge technology, such as a scaled-up version of the Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) program, ‚ÄúAmerica‚Äôs seed fund,‚Äù which provides capital to small businesses pursuing R&amp;D commercialization in concert with research institutions

‚Ä¢	Funds for creation or expansion of technical training programs around digital, statistical, and technology skills, funded by the Labor Department

‚Ä¢	Infrastructure for educational institutions and partners to expand research

‚Ä¢	Ensure technological change benefits workers, creates jobs, and strengthens the middle class

‚Ä¢	Ensure U.S. government captures a share of the royalties of high-profitable products developed with federal R&amp;D funding

‚Ä¢	Give workers a voice in innovation and are first in line to benefit


-------------------


#USE FULL U.S. TALENTS &amp; INVEST IN COMMUNITIES AND WORKERS 

The economic opportunities from investment in innovation are not being shared throughout the U.S. - 25% percent of venture capital investment is concentrated in the San Francisco area, and 75% flows to just three states: California, New York, and Massachusetts. There are a significant number of diverse communities across every region of the country which can become new centers of job-creating innovation and production. 

‚Ä¢	Direct new federal investments to more than 50 communities across our nation that have the capabilities but have too often been overlooked

‚Ä¢	Creating at least 200 new centers serving as research incubators and connect students underrepresented in fields critical to our nation‚Äôs future

‚Ä¢	Dedicating additional and increased priority funding streams at federal agencies for grants and contracts for HBCUs and MSIs

‚Ä¢	Requiring any federal research grants to universities with an endowment of over $1 billion to form a meaningful partnership and enter into a 10% minimum subcontract with an HBCU, TCU, or MSI

‚Ä¢	Require competitive grant programs give similar universities opportunities to compete against each other, for example, ensuring that HBCUs only compete against HBCUs

----------------


#JOB &amp; EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITY

‚Ä¢	Career and technical education for high school students

‚Ä¢	Free high-quality training programs

‚Ä¢	Free community college and free tuition for 4-year degrees for families earning less than $125,000

‚Ä¢	Invest $50 billion in high-quality training programs that give workers a chance to earn an industry-recognized credential without debt

‚Ä¢	Create and expand community college-business-union partnerships to develop effective training programs

‚Ä¢	Scale up work-based learning programs with a focus on building a diverse workforce, through opportunities like registered apprenticeships, pre-apprenticeship, and other labor-management training programs

‚Ä¢	Work with unions to bring forward a new generation of registered apprenticeships in fields ranging from technology to manufacturing to care work, allowing workers who have lost their jobs during the pandemic to train for jobs of the future while earning a decent income

‚Ä¢	Help develop pathways for diverse workers to access training and career opportunities

‚Ä¢	**Extend unemployment Insurance benefits** for the duration of training, up-skilling, and reskilling programs while unemployment rates are elevated

‚Ä¢	Invest $70 billion in Historically Black Colleges and Universities, Tribal Colleges and Universities, and Minority-Serving Institutions

‚Ä¢	Invest $35 billion in HBCUs, TCUs, and MSIs to create research centers of excellence, build high-tech labs and other facilities, and strengthen graduate programs in fields including STEM

‚Ä¢	Tackle workplace discrimination and harassment keeping so many women, especially women of color, from earning equal pay or fully realizing their professional goals


------------------


#PRO-AMERICAN-WORKER TAX AND TRADE STRATEGY

‚Ä¢	Take aggressive trade enforcement actions against China or any other country seeking to undercut American manufacturing through unfair practices, including currency manipulation, anti-competitive dumping, state-owned company abuses, or unfair subsidies

‚Ä¢	Coordinated effort to pressure the Chinese government and other trade abusers to follow the rules and hold them to account when they do not

‚Ä¢	Confront foreign efforts to steal American intellectual property

‚Ä¢	Address state-sponsored cyber espionage against American companies

‚Ä¢	Set forth clear demands and specific consequences if China‚Äôs government does not cease cyber espionage

‚Ä¢	Develop new sanctions authorities against Chinese firms which steal U.S. technology,which will cut them off from accessing the U.S. market and financial system

‚Ä¢	Establish a ‚Äúclaw-back‚Äù provision to force a company to return public investments and tax benefits when they close down jobs here and send them overseas

‚Ä¢	Apply carbon adjustment fee against countries who are failing to meet their Paris Climate commitments

‚Ä¢	Reverse tax policies that encourage outsourcing

‚Ä¢	End incentives in the Trump tax giveaway that allow multinationals to dramatically lower taxes on income earned overseas and allow the largest, most profitable companies to pay no tax at all

‚Ä¢	Confront global tax secrecy and avoidance, taking on individuals and businesses that stash their profits in tax havens to avoid paying their fair share

‚Ä¢	Tighten anti-inversion rules that Obama-Biden put in place and which Trump has sought to weaken

‚Ä¢	Support strong and independent trade unions here in the United States and in every one of our trading partners

‚Ä¢	Enforce existing labor provisions and aggressively push for strong and enforceable labor provisions in any trade deal his administration

------------------

#BRING BACK CRITICAL SUPPLY CHAINS

‚Ä¢	Never again face shortages of critical products such as medical equipment when confronting a national crisis.

‚Ä¢	Put Americans to work making critical products, from medical equipment and supplies to semiconductors and communications technology, here in the United States

‚Ä¢	Close critical U.S. supply chain gaps by immediately directing a comprehensive and ongoing process to evaluate and protect key U.S. supply chains, starting in the first  

‚Ä¢	Leverage federal buying, including the Defense Production Act, BARDA, and federal procurement, to make sure that we make critical products in America

‚Ä¢	Change the tax code to eliminate the incentives for pharmaceutical and other companies to move production overseas and establish new incentives for companies to make critical products in the U.S

‚Ä¢	Rebuild critical stockpiles, ensure adequate surge manufacturing capacity in times of crisis, and regularly review supply chain vulnerabilities

‚Ä¢	Work with allies to reduce their dependence on competitors like China while modernizing international trade rules to secure U.S. and allied supply chains

1594408694,"Hey everyone. My good friend and I just signed up to make volunteer calls for Joe Biden. I'm a progressive Democrat who doesn't love Biden, but I understand the weight of this election and want to do my part in helping vote Trump out of office at all costs. However, I have a few questions--as the signup process wasn't very detailed--and I'm hoping that some of you (maybe those who also volunteer) may know the answers. 

Firstly, who are we are calling? Are they registered Democrats? Independents? Republicans? People who aren't registered? A mix? And as a follow-up, if these people are not registered, should I have voter registration information on hand for the state in which I'm making calls? 

Secondly, do the call recipients see your phone number? If so, is there a way to prevent that? 

Thirdly, what's the protocol if people have questions or concerns regarding issues not covered in the provided script? I'm pretty familiar with Joe Biden's platform and stances on issues, however, I'm not an expert on policy and his more nuanced viewpoints. 

Lastly, how should volunteers proceed when a call goes south? In other words, what's the rule of thumb if a recipient doesn't take kindly to a call, and makes rude and obnoxious remarks? 

Thanks in advance for any and all advice! 

P.S. I have some prior experience with cold calling, and I'm definitely not shy, so I'm not too worried about actually making the calls. I just want to make sure I'm as mentally prepared as possible before doing so. Thanks again!

I have been inside this subreddit for a while now. I‚Äôm a Thai student who takes a keen interest in American politics. I would have voted Democratic if I‚Äôm American. But instead, I just live in a country where Democracy is nowhere to be seen.

At this moment in time, in my home country, Thailand, we find ourselves in a regime where our voices are left unheard by the system. Those who espoused Democratic ideals are either harassed to death, or been put to pasture by either the authorities, or the loss of hope.

Well, I‚Äôm not here to talk about my country. What I‚Äôm trying to say is that I‚Äôm rooting for y‚Äôall to succeed in the upcoming election. I might disagree with what the Democrats are doing to some degree. I still believe that you guys are still doing right fighting for the American Dream. The dream of which my friends and I in Thailand is looking up to.

For the sake of everyone else around the world, the results of the American election are important. We look up to the US as a moral guidance towards the Democratic principles. We want you to succeed and continue to be the beacon of hope for all of us who yearn to breathe free around the world.

We‚Äôll keep a close watch on y‚Äôall with great interest. Until then, good luck to all!",democrats,A word of encouragement from Thailand

They had my grandmother who married a my grandfather, a Mexican man, and raised their family in Los Angeles.

My father was an orphan in Pittsburgh and adopted by an Italian and Irish couple. After serving in the Navy he moved west to Los Angeles and met my mother.

My mother worked until she was diagnosed with chronic kidney disease. She raised me as a single mother, and is still here with us today, her medical bills covered by government healthcare.

I‚Äôve worked, and have done well enough to have my own place back in Washington.

I think my family has done well in this country; after starting, for the most part, with nothing.

America is great, America is horrible.

Part of growing up and maturing is realizing things are not black and white, horrendous things have happened in America, great things have happened here.

1593543867,"This is something I think should be said in this subreddit and the democratic party more broadly. The political environment seems to be shifting toward democrats. But the party needs to think about what they represent and how they can create lasting progressive change. 

The past half century has been dominated by conservative politics and failures to address what seem like basic principles in a wealthy, democratic society. The US situations on healthcare, racial and economic inequality, money in politics, and so many other things are just ridiculously bad. 

There has been some growing attention to progressive issues. But many in the democratic party seem to favor policies which do not really solve problems on the scale they exist. Futhermore, many are more willing to listen to Mitt Romney supporters than actual solutions on the scale of actual problems. [https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-never-trumpers-crashed-the-democratic-party/](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-never-trumpers-crashed-the-democratic-party/)

In addition to never passing the necessary progressive policy to fix problems, trying to be moderate lets republicans control the political environment. Winning with middle of the road policies is not success if one side gets to choose where the middle is. Let alone losing with middle of the road policies which fail to produce the ideology and excitement of actual change. 

Trump is not a very good politician (he's consistently but not extremely unpopular) but he is very good at one thing: controlling the political conversation. The 2016 election was a prime example. If we focus on just not being Trump, we may be not overly racist, not climate change deniers, not actively dismantling the ACA, not have a cabinet of billionaires, etc, but we will not be antiracist, act against climate change on the required scale, achieve universal (and affordable to everyone) healthcare, and counter the growing economic inequality of the past half century. 

We also might end up with Ivanka Trump (or comparable) as president in 2024: someone who thinks the same things, but speaks with more tact. This would not happen if we make politics about solving problems to help real people on the scale that is necessary.",democrats,"(My opinion, that I believe needs to be stated) Our policies should decided by our values and what is necessary to solve the problems we face. Not based on a flawed political environment and ""two sided"" debate that has been shaped by neoliberals, republicans, and now Trump."

We‚Äôre in a battle for the soul of the nation ‚Äî and the President has picked a side. But make no mistake: it‚Äôs a battle we will win.
1593380254,"   My whole life I have dreamed of being the President of the United States. Every chance I got, I would debate, I would argue, I would speech-write and contemplate about the biggest issues that our country faced. I would try every time and every place I could to improve my political thought and continue to learn. But now, I have to face the fact that by the time I could really mount a campaign, there would be no America left. 

       Since the Reagan-Bush years, the economy had been having problems. Problems that were popularized by the Clinton Campaign‚Äôs ‚ÄúIts the economy, stupid.‚Äù Along with failing health care systems and party fatigue, Bill Clinton rose to office and for 8 years, presided over unprecedented economic growth, with a massive budget surplus by the end of his tenure. But then, George Bush Jr. takes office. In another 8 years, the economy would be tanking in a way that was paralleled only by the Great Depression. Republicans fail, even with the popular and caring John McCain, to beat the young and enigmatic Barack Obama. 

      For his two terms, President Obama does the unpopular but necessary work to bring the economy back.  And it works - the economy experiences, once again, unprecedented job growth and what could have been a new Great Depression is halted and reversed. And that brings us to 2016 - a sure thing for the Dems, one would think. A stable economy, glad allies, faith in our leadership restored, and more - yet on Election Day, Donald Trump is brought into office. And despite enjoying some economic growth at the start of his term, the Covid-19 pandemic results in an economic crash that, as of the time of writing this, could end out worse than the 08 Recession. Faith in US leadership around the world plummets below even the Bush Jr. years. 

    So here we are - an unpopular president from a quickly-shrinking party, and if Joe Biden wins in November, he has 8, or perhaps more realistically 4, years to fix all of it. Is it even possible for him to do so? Will our allies ever be able to trust a flip-flopping country that at once wants the best for all of the West and suddenly turns inward and ignores them for years?

       I don‚Äôt have an answer for it, nor do I have any real words of encouragement. But I can say that I have hope. No matter what may happen come November, we can take some solace in the fact that we weren‚Äôt the ones who brought down this country. At least we stood up for Freedom. At least we tried.",democrats,The Democratic Party is effectively a cleanup crew.

1593011292,"The great thing about the Black Lives Matter movement is the degree to which the extent of racism in our society has been brought to the attention of more people.  Young people, in particular, have been energized at levels not seen since the Obama campaigns, which of course, waned in the Clinton campaign, and contributed to the rise of Donald Trump. Let‚Äôs hope it translates to the ballot box in November.

In 1968, Martin Luther King, Jr. altered his focus, and emphasized income inequality, rather than white-black relations, as the most important all- encompassing issue of social justice.  He created the Poor People‚Äôs Campaign.  (I marched in its seminal event on April 26, 1968 in Washington.)  There are those that feel King was assassinated because he altered his focus to an area that was a much greater threat to the powers that be, namely, the pitfalls of American capitalism.

The Black Lives Matter website states:

*Four years ago, what is now known as the Black Lives Matter Global Network began to organize. It started out as a chapter-based, member-led organization whose mission was to build local power and to intervene when violence was inflicted on Black communities by the state and vigilantes.*

*In the years since, we‚Äôve committed to struggling together and to imagining and creating a world free of anti-Blackness, where every Black person has the social, economic, and political power to thrive.*

Of course, the protests we‚Äôve been witnessing have been focused on police racism, and less so, on economic racism.

The Center for Policing Equity at John Jay College of Criminal Justice, CUNY, is one of the few think tanks doing scientific research on police racism.  They have documented this discordance in policing between black and white communities, and have been working with police departments for many years.  Their director, Phillip A. Goff, is an inspiring individual, and his TED talk is worth checking out. 

For decades, journalists have been documenting the  racial disparities in the field of health care (to give but one example of another institution‚Äôs racism) , resulting in thousands of needless deaths. 600,000 American children have died in the last 50 years from preventable causes, with black children dying at a rate 2-3x higher than white children.  US infant mortality is the highest among Western democracies.  (And our neighbor Cuba puts us to shame in that category.) There are dozens of similar statistics.

240 million calls are made to 9-1-1 annually.  What people need to remember is that every single one of those responders is prepared to die for YOU.  Even the monster Derek Chauvin, had been willing to die for every single emergency call he responded to in his career.

How many of you are willing to die for your fellow human beings on a daily basis?

Racism is imbued in all our institutions.  The policing system surely has its problems, but if you‚Äôre counting deaths at the hands of racism, income inequality and health care disparities are much bigger problems.

From moment Trump came down the escalator there was suspicion of the validity of his campaign. This first big red flag was Paul Manafort and then Carter Page. Then Assagne and Wikileaks and the the enormous cloud of Russian election interference. Trump staff met hundreds of times handing data to the Russians, so much that it was obvious that there is some form of a deal going on. Then we find out about Trump Tower Moscow and large loans made possible by a Russian co-signer.

The questions remain. 

Will the Supreme Court allow oversight, or will the decision be political and partisan with the decisions made within the next week?

And we have the dealings of McConnell with Deripaska. The very guy who was in the middle of the Russian interference. 

What kind of deal was made by the GOP with the Russians?

This is bullshit and the acceptance of these dealings with a hostile foreign power should not be accepted by the American people. If we don‚Äôt have a vote then we have nothing.",democrats,America needs to get to the bottom of these issues for it‚Äôs survival as a Democracy.

1592699748,"Hi all.

I'm trying to gain a fuller understanding of political positions in the US during this very turbulent time. I'm not American but I do have a general understanding of American history as it formed part of my history degree. So for instance, I am aware of how parties have shifted stance over time, the history of chattel slavery and plantation life in the US, and I'm aware broadly of debates surrounding States Rights vs Lost Cause narratives of the civil war and commemorations of it. Further, I understand why they are significant at the moment with the removal of confederate monuments and so forth.

I was hoping if someone could fill me in on the 'democratic position' (although I know this will vary) in relation to recent events, the current political climate and race relations?

As much as possible I'm looking for answers that are sophisticated and considered, and that explain 'why' where necessary, and give sources for data, figures and quotes if used. I understand that things are very tense over there at the moment but if we could avoid rhetoric, being uncivil and mudslinging, it would be more helpful for my understanding of your position.

Hope to hear.",democrats,Help me out.

**Rex Tillerson: Former Secretary of State**

Mike Pompeo is doing a great job, I am very proud of him. His predecessor, Rex Tillerson, didn‚Äôt have the mental capacity needed. He was dumb as a rock and I couldn‚Äôt get rid of him fast enough. He was lazy as hell. Now it is a whole new ballgame, great spirit at State!

**James Mattis: Former Secretary of Defense**

‚Ä¶His primary strength was not military, but rather personal public relations. I gave him a new life, things to do, and battles to win, but he seldom ‚Äúbrought home the bacon‚Äù. I didn‚Äôt like his ‚Äúleadership‚Äù style or much else about him, and many others agree. Glad he is gone!

Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 4, 2020

**John Kelly: Former Director of Homeland Security, White House Chief of Staff**

..which he actually has a military and legal obligation to do. His incredible wife, Karen, who I have a lot of respect for, once pulled me aside &amp; said strongly that ‚ÄúJohn respects you greatly. When we are no longer here, he will only speak well of you.‚Äù Wrong!

Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 13, 2020

**Michael Flynn: Former White House National Security Adviser**

I had to fire General Flynn because he lied to the Vice President and the FBI. He has pled guilty to those lies. It is a shame because his actions during the transition were lawful. There was nothing to hide!

Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 2, 2017

**Steve Bannon: Former White House Chief Strategist**

Michael Wolff ... used Sloppy Steve Bannon, who cried when he got fired and begged for his job. Now Sloppy Steve has been dumped like a dog by almost everyone. Too bad!

Jeff, you had your chance &amp; you blew it. Recused yourself ON DAY ONE (you never told me of a problem), and ran for the hills. You had no courage, &amp; ruined many lives. The dirty cops, &amp; others, got caught by better &amp; stronger people than you. Hopefully this slime will pay a big‚Ä¶

I was NOT going to fire Bob Mueller, and did not fire Bob Mueller. In fact, he was allowed to finish his Report with unprecedented help from the Trump Administration. Actually, lawyer Don McGahn had a much better chance of being fired than Mueller. Never a big fan!

I am a Canadian, although I find I have been following US Politics ever since Trump became President. 

I never really stayed up to date on US political news before this, but I find that every day is just revelation after revelation, argument after argument. 

My question is, what were the news cycles like during the Obama Administration? The Bush Administration? Before?

Has the news just ramped up their focus on the presidency, or has it always been this....intense? Did the sides switch in the Obama Administration, where FOX was trying to shine a light on the Presidents missteps with facts, and CNN/MSNBC blindly defending him? Same question with the Bush Administration?

Just wanted to know what it was like back then, and if what we are witnessing now especially and in these past four years is anything special, or (if Biden wins this year) we can just expect more books, more bombshell interviews, more secret sources speaking out etc etc.

Thank you!",democrats,What was the news cycle like in previous administrations??
