I am a PT so i have a very general knowledge of medicine and the human body. My fiance is a RN i find it fascinating how all my friends in the medical  community have dismissed this virus. Aren't these the people you should discuss matters of health. Yes for sane people it is however are slanted left controlled media has decided that it has more knowledge of the situation. Liberals are literally taking the advise of idiots like Nancy Pelosi, Anderson Cooper, Sleepy Joe and who can forget the king himself TOM FUCKING WOLF. I can not believe the overall stupidity of my generation. As a male in his mid 20s its hard to find younger people that think like me. I didnt drink the liberal milkshake that is forced down your throat at college I held strong to my beliefs and ideals. I am honestly so concerned with the future of this country. This libtards actually believe that their cloth mask will protect them from the ""deadliest virus"" in human history. When in reality john hopkins produced a study that said the infection rate of this virus is 10x higher than what is being reported... umm people wake the fuck up that means the death rate is 1/10th of what is being reported. Which means statically speaking you are more likely to die from receiving the influenza vaccine than fucking covid. Sorry Im all over the place I had to rant a little",Republican,The state of Pennsylvania is done.

1595434831,"First off I’m not affiliated w Q at all. I don’t think Hilary is drinking children’s blood and getting high off of it. That is LUDACRIS. HOWEVER, I DO believe Chrissy Teigen IS a child molester and has spent years trying to desensitize people to pedophilia . Whether she’s been doing this subconsciously or intentionally, who really knows. 

Chrissy has been bullying anyone who disagrees w her for YEARS and calling them a white supremacist first off. She is by far the most dangerous, hateful person on Twitters platform. So the fact that she wants to play the victim when it’s her turn to get (justifiably) cancelled, really just proves how much of a delusional narcissist she really is. 

Chrissy threatened to leave twitter because of the “bullying” she’s getting (even though her behavior proves she’s guilty af.) So because of this, Twitter decides to ban anyone affiliated with Qanon. Twitter is a private platform and they have the right to do whatever they want. But they cannot, in good conscience, consider themselves a fair platform as far as I’m concerned. Especially when they antifa , pedophilia , liberal bullying etc run rampant on their site. 

Once again, I know the Q crowd is pretty nutty. But what I think twitter is actually attempting to do is silence all republicans. It’s ironic to me, because jack dorsey once said that conservatives who work for him don’t feel comfortable voicing their opinions. 

https://www.google.com/amp/s/thehill.com/policy/technology/406927-twitter-ceo-jack-dorsey-conservative-employees-dont-feel-safe-to-express%3famp

I would bet my life that jack has NEVER hired a single conservative. In fact , I know someone who works for twitter (he’s radically left) and even HE grows tired of all liberal bs. Yet, he’s been vocally supportive of this decision. Just as colleges and universities have become leftist indoctrination camps, it seems tech companies have inevitably been met with the same fate. Companies like Facebook and Twitter have been censoring republicans for YEARS. How much further will this go? Share your thoughts.",Republican,Twitters allegiance to the mob... my thoughts

I personally believe the US is the greatest nation that has ever existed. As an American I know I am biased but looking at it as objectively as I can; we’re the most prosperous nation that’s ever existed. The US has provided more opportunity to more people than any other nation in history which is why tens of millions of people have immigrated here and millions continue to try and do so. We’re the most influential country on earth. Look at the news cycle while in Europe or another part of the world, everyone pays attention to what happens here. Everyone listens to American music and American movies. The American military’s presence throughout the world has provided what you could call a second Pax Romana. We’re the most charitable nation. I could keep going but I think you get the picture. The reason why I’m writing this is a post on the front page of reddit showing how the US is one of the worst places to raise a family.

We live in a once great nation where we served our God and country (I'm not trying to discredit other religions) and we had true love for what this nation stands for. Now the government reaches to far into our day to day lives 
Did you know that it's easier for an 11 year old to watch hardcore pornography online then it is to have a legal lemonade stand. 

Can you name a win for us in the past few years? Cause we have failed on gun policy, immigration policy, abortion policy and healthcare policy.

Now what have we done successfully? Well we beat Marxism when the USSR fell but we still have it today and 
(dumb) people still want it around. That's the biggest thing we have accomplished. 

Now I realise the left hates America and that's why they want to change it. They want to kill children. They want to sexualize the children that make it out of the womb too. Now not to mention that almost everything they want will cause the destruction of the United States of America as we know it. Everything they want is either immoral or had been proven impossible. 

They want to take away our gun rights and our rights to religion and freedom of speech. People want to take away our gun rights first so we can't fight back when they take the rest of them. Now not to mention that the school systems that are teaching todays youth are teaching them that guns are bad and healthcare should be universal and that life doesn't really start in the womb and that it's just a clump of cells and this isn't just some statistic... I know because I'm there everyday and when I speak out for what's right i get a lowered grade. Hell I was sick for 2 weeks and my liberal teacher kicked me out of her class because there was ""too much to catch up on"" even though the only thing they did was watch the popular medical drama ""House M.D""

Now we need to speak up for what's right now if you want to help then watch John Doyle on YouTube I will link you to a good video of his. Now after you watch this look at the second part. I hope you all have a wonderful day and good bless!

However, it is also clear that cancel culture is highly one-sided, and not to our own advantage. If conservatives want to gain ground on the mainstream social scene, especially with young folks, then we must grab the metaphorical pitchfork and point it in the opposite direction. 

Drew Brees was crucified by the media and social media simply for being patriotic, but those such Nick Cannon made various racist statements and came out largely unscathed. If we want more dominance, then we need more aggression and less passivity on the social stage. A man who states he hates black people will quickly be made jobless, and the same should happen to those who make similar statements towards white people (Sarah Jeong for example).",Republican,Conservatives need to adopt and utilize cancel culture.

""Trump calls protesters 'angry mob' in fourth of july speech h""

Now this:
https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.usatoday.com/amp/1646901002

0 BIAS here - I dont like trump. At all. But the media desperate stir things up. He never called protesters an angry mob. I read the article. The headline contains a false statement. How is this acceptable?

He called people that are tearing down statues and defacing public property- an angry mob. Ummm...let's see..I dont care if the statues are of Satan, a bunch of people tearing them down without due course... can accurately be described as an 'angry mob'

These are actual crimes they are committing.

When I say 'they' I refer to each of them as human beings that are making conscious choices to commit crimes.

No, I don't mean blacks or Democrats. That would be grouping people, which is what we are supposed to be fighting, right? Well the only grouping I see is being done by people that seem to want to 'solve the problem' the most.

We fell for it. The media, owned by the elite powers that be, are simply telling us to keep fighting instead of joining hands together and improving impoverished communities and helping broken families and failing public schools.

It is so sad how the masses are turned into sheep by mass media and political parties.

1594187493,"Liberal immigrant: USA is great

America is a pretty great place to live

I am as left as they come.  I protested with BLM. I vote blue down the line. I strive for equality. 


Throughout the last few weeks I have seem
turmoil in the place I was born; Cops killing minorities, COVID taking whoever it wants, riots that get out of hand. 

However, (here it comes)

My family immigrated here about 40 years ago. In our country, my family was nothing. We couldn’t get any help. A decent public education was unheard of. Fire brigades don’t exist. My parents saved everything they had and  immigrated to USA legally. Since then my parents were able to work hard and eventually open 3 stores in my town. I was able to go to college. Now I am working at a company that pays me well. I have a wife and a child on the way! I own a house and even have 2 pets. 

I can’t imagine my life if my parents didn’t move to USA. I love my heritage in Iran, but I feel like my parents made the right decision.

It hurts my heart to see the party I support disparage the country just because the person in office is trump. It seems that people here want to tear down the foundation of this country. The foundation that my parents left there families for, just so I could have a better life in a free country. 

I hate racist cops, but at least we have cops who
dont take bribes. At least we have cops. My parents tell me stories of times where criminals would
threaten them and the only recourse was to hide and wait. 

I hate confederate statues, but tearing down George Washingtons, Abraham Lincoln doesn’t make sense to me. They were the ones to make this land free for all? I recently found that some foundation fathers had slaves. We all condemn that, but we all have sins. If we can only make statue of sinless person, then there won’t be statues. 

I am all for change, I want to end police brutality. But please don’t try to rip up the foundation of this country. I am here, and I want future people like me
to experience it as well. I want my son to see why his grandparents sacrificed so much so he could
Live here.

I just had a question regarding centrists on both the left or right. I would call myself a independent as I agree with arguments from both sides for different issues but love having discourse. I talked to a bunch of different people today and they told me joe Biden is more of a centrist rather than left progressive. They also told me that left wing figures such as Kamela Harris are left but not far left candidates. Do you believe this to be true? And also I would like to ask who is a conservative centrist that you know that’s a public figure or was a past president. 

Thank you",Republican,Question regarding left and right

1594054335,"I think the president had been too much on the ""self-defense"" mode in the past few months. He spent a great deal of time during his various speeches telling us what he achieved in the past 3 years, and over and over again how it was all destroyed by the Plague. He even spent some 20 min in Tulsa to entertain how he had no issue holding a cup and walking down a ramp. I think while it's good to clarify things, moving forward we the voters need to hear what he has planned for the next 4 years if he was re-elected.

If I was his campaign manager I would first tell the public what \*\*legacy\*\* was achieved in the last term despite the Plague. For example, the empowerment of the conservative - how 4 years ago being conservative was always ridiculed and people shied from expressing conservative ideas, but now we have bigger voice on the media like Tucker Carlson, we have our own social media Parler, we are no longer afraid of being politically incorrect. Also, how we were able to get rid of external terrorist threat and how it enables us to focus on domestic issues. Don't just boast - tell the implications for our future.

And then, it's high time for the president to lay out exactly what he plan to achieve in the next 4 years. For example, if he really wants to stop China from being our threat, how will he do that? How will he address and fix the racial tension? How will he continue to improve healthcare for vulnerable people? How will he help America live with the COVID? How will he take the advantage of low interest rates and spend money on infrastructures, something he promised to do earlier this year but details would be great.

Basically, you see Biden and his supporters are trying to induce hate for the president, saying Trump is the cause of all problems etc., and they do that because they have nothing to show. He didn't achieve anything and they have no plans. Biden becoming the president makes him not an actual leader but just a symbol of leftism, for those who would vote for him just to have him in office and do nothing. So the president needs to show to the people that he's not gonna just be a symbol for the conservatives, but he will actually implement what he believes in.",Republican,A little bit outlook into the future can go a long way

Old adage: A conservative is a liberal who has been mugged by reality.

Benjamin Franklin: “An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.”

Abraham Lincoln: “Important principles may, and must be inflexible.” 

Guns are a necessary tool designed to help your people avoid a repeat of history. A.E. Samaan

Benjamin Franklin: ""Those who would give up essential Liberty, to purchase a little temporary Safety, deserve neither Liberty nor Safety.

Most gun control arguments miss the point. If all control boils fundamentally to force, how can one resist aggression without equal force? How can a truly “free” state exist if the individual citizen is enslaved to the forceful will of individual or organized aggressors? It cannot. Tiffany Madison

Prohibition... goes beyond the bounds of reason in that it attempts to control a man's appetite by legislation and makes a crime out of things that are not crimes... A prohibition law strikes a blow at the very principles upon which our government was founded.

1593880563,"A little bit about myself. I came to the US about 6 years ago from a wealthy middle eastern country as an international student. In the place where I come from ( super muslim community,)  I'm considered to be very liberal. 

My first in person exposure to US politics, came through a major liberal university campus where you'd considered evil if you identify republican. I got to witness the insane meltdown people went through when Trump got elected in 2016. I remember my gf at the time crying while she's telling me I'm going to get deported.  Now obviously, that didn't happen. 

Due to my background and skin color, everybody around me assumed I was liberal. Because I considered myself to be liberal in middle eastern standards I kinda went along with that too. It wasn't until recently that I started questioning that notion. 

I find that most of my ethical and economic beliefs are conservative. The only thing that I don't quite get is why conservatives support smaller goverments. 

Almost every thing I can find online is either baised or too complicated for me to understand.

1593777817,"I mean, I get it. Communism and socialism as systems really don’t work, it’s been tried and failed. And actual communism has led to horrible cruelty and abuse of power by governments.

However, as a citizen of a Nordic country, I don’t understand. Our society, I reckon, is seen as blatantly socialist by Americans. Yes we do pay relatively high taxes and there is probably more regulation that would actually be efficient.

On the other hand, we don’t need to pay jack shit for healthcare, no need to worry about health insurance or that losing a job or having to have surgery or to call an ambulance would bankrupt us. And no I don’t wait for months or even weeks to see a doctor with an urgent matter, if I tell that my matter is urgent then I get to the doctor the next day at the latest.

Yet, the society is free, and the economy is capitalist.

We do have gun control, but that’s just to have sufficient background checks and to register who all has weapons. It’s not hard to pass, my country has probably the highest rate of firearms per capita in Europe. We hunt a lot. But there’s very little gun violence.

So I guess my question is, why are leftist politics basically painted as some monster fascist control system? I don’t mean every country should run like mine does, that’s fine and different systems have different strong points. 

But don’t you think there would be some good to come out of just, you know, tipping your pinky toe into socialism from time to time? Not a lot, just a little. Just so that the society would have a basic safety net for people who fall into some hard times.",Republican,Can you guys help me understand why socialist-leaning politics are seen as the devil by Republicans?
1593775034,"I saw a video of a black man recording and giving away a white woman’s address because she called him the n word, the video received lots of positive attention and he even made money off of it by selling t shirts with quotes from the encounter. What the woman did was inexcusable, but the fact that he gave away her address and people online are supporting and encouraging such behavior, is also inexcusable imo. He followed her to her house and she was crying, because she thought her life was ruined and it pretty much is when it’s all over the news, she probably lost her job and now people know where she lives and this is encouraged by the news, by social media and by BLM supporters. It’s just wrong, it reminds me of back in the day if a white man followed a black man to his home because he called him a cracker, then his life would most likely be ended, but I believe there’s something reminiscent of that happening rn and because it’s happening to white people, no one really dares to speak out against it or else they’ll be deemed racist by the racist liberals",Republican,One thing that’s currently wrong with the country that no one really cares about

Do you see how pathetically the media is covering what reddit just did?  Almost every headline focuses on reddit banning The_Donald for ""hate speech violations.""

Chapotraphouse, which was full of leftist calls to violence is mentioned as an afterthought if at all.

And The Donald has been dead for MONTHS.  The admins killed it and they moved to another site.  No one has been posting there.

But they wanted a headline saying that they had banned it for hate.

That's bullshit.  They didn't ban it for hate.  The banned it because they wanted that headline right now.

They banned Chapo so they'd have cover to say this was unbiased.

But the actual BIG STORY is that reddit is biased now.

As you read these words from Spez I want you to remember:

""All animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others.""

Spez: ""While the rule on hate protects such groups, it does not protect all groups or all forms of identity. For example, the rule does not protect groups of people who are in the majority or who promote such attacks of hate.""

One of the protected groups is illegal immigrants.

But apparently, if you are in a ""majority"" group... it's fine on reddit for people to say that you are subhuman scum.  Hate against YOU is not actionable.

What a lovely free-speech place!

And reddit wasn't transparent in the subreddits that I banned.  You got to know what a FEW of them were (including **The_Donald natch because they wanted THAT headline**_

But r/hatecrimehoaxes is gone.  So is r/campusconservatives?  For some reason?  And r/rightwinglgbt...

https://www.reddit.com/r/WatchRedditDie/comments/hi43c3/list_of_subs_that_have_been_banned_today/

AHS and others are already sharpening their knives to come after r/conservative.  If they manage to take it down, r/republican will be next...

The reign of terror see... it doesn't ever stop.

That's why you should never START it.

Personally, I think that this is the beginning of the end of reddit.  And it's been fun.  I mean...it's also been crap for conservatives and especially mods who have been targeted for harassment by the lefty hordes.

But that's gonna be fine now.  Because they will say that we are in the majority...so we aren't protected from hate the way everyone else is protected from hate.

This was a scam.",Republican,"What just happened? A lesson in media headlines, Reddit narrative crafting and and an illustration of how messed up it all is."

For the initial part of the scene, different actors, one black and one Hispanic, portray Derek and Hansel, with the main characters' voices dubbed over. Off screen the makeup is removed and Stiller and Wilson comeback as themselves with dark makeup covering all of their bodies EXCEPT their actual faces. Even around their faces is darkened with makeup. I wonder if Stiller knew what he was doing, and used a loophole of darkening with makeup everything but his face so he could say, ""well, I didn't actually use 'blackface.'"" 

Here is a link to the end of the full scene, with the makeup providing their disguises removed. Clever, Ben. Very clever.

“Your children's children will live under communism. 
You Americans are so gullible. 
No, you won't accept communism outright; but, we will keep feeding you small doses of socialism until you will finally wake up and find you already have Communism.
We will not have to fight you. 
We will so weaken your economy, until you will fall like overripe fruit into our hands. 
The democracy will cease to exist when you take away from those who are willing to work and give to those who would not""

At that time, just the word ""communism"" was feared throughout our nation.

Remember this: Socialism is Communism

How do you create a Socialist State? 

There are eight levels of control:

1) Healthcare - Control healthcare and you control the people
2) Poverty - Increase the poverty level as high as possible, poor people are easier to control and will not fight back if you are providing everything for them.
3) Debt - Increase the debt to an unsustainable level. That way you are able to increase taxes, and this will produce more poverty.
4) Gun Control - Remove the ability to defend themselves from the government . That way you are able to create a police state.
5) Welfare - Take control of every aspect (food, housing, income) of their lives because that will make them fully dependent on the government.
6) Education - Take control of what people read, listen to and take control of what children learn in school.
7) Religion - Remove the belief in God from the government and schools because the people need to believe in ONLY the government knowing what is best for the people.
8)Class Warfare - Divide the people into the wealthy and the poor. Eliminate the middle class. This will cause more discontent and it will be easier to tax the rich with the support of the poor.

It is there duty to uphold the oath they took when we put them in office..

Senators Oath

Oath of Office. Upon taking office, senators-elect must swear or affirm that they will ""support and defend the Constitution."" The President of the Senate or a surrogate administers the oath to newly elected or re-elected senators. The oath is required by the Constitution; the wording is prescribed by law.

What oath must state and federal officials take?

“The Senators and Representatives before mentioned, and the Members of the several State Legislatures, and all executive and judicial Officers, both of the United States and of the several States, shall be bound by Oath or Affirmation, to support this Constitution; but no religious Test shall ever be required as a ...

Governors Oath

I (Governor) do solemnly swear that I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States and the Constitution of the State of 
_________ against all enemies foreign and domestic, that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the Constitution of the United States and the Constitution of the State of ________

Do mayors take an oath of office?

When persons elected to office take the oath, they swear or affirm that they will faithfully and impartially discharge the duties of the office to the best of their ability.

Penalty for Violating the Oath in Georgia

If a public officer is convicted of violating the oath in Georgia, the punishment will be a prison term between one and five years. They will be guilty of a felony.

Is violation of oath of office a crime?

Some oaths of office are a statement of loyalty to a constitution or other legal text or to a person or other office-holder (e.g., an oath to support the constitution of the state, or of loyalty to the President). Under the laws of a state it may be considered treason or a high crime to betray a sworn oath of office.

County Commissioners Oath

I, _____, do solemnly swear [or affirm] that I will support the Constitution of the United States and the Constitution and laws of the State of_________, and all local ordinances, and that I will faithfully and impartially perform and discharge the duties of the office of _____, according to the law and the best of ...

So thats why PresidentTrump said the states need to Govern themselves ""by the oath they took when they took office""

What is the President's oath when taking office?

""I do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will faithfully execute the office of President of the ""United States"" , and will to the best of my ability, preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States.""

No where in that oath does it say he has to babysit the elected officials for each state. 

So these elected officials need to stop blaming President Trump for the failures of the oath they swore to uphold..

Do your fucking job that We the People elected you to do!!

We the People are Pissed Off

Academia is becoming unacceptably ideological. Not only are there entire fields dedicated to inherently leftist ways of thinking - e.g., gender studies, anthropology and sociology - but there's an immense overrepresentation of academics with left-wing views.

A study from the Adam Smith Institute found:

""Individuals with left-wing and liberal views are overrepresented in British academia. Those with right-wing and conservative views are correspondingly underrepresented. Around 50% of the general public supports right-wing or conservative parties, compared to less than 12% of academics.""

https://www.adamsmith.org/research/lackademia-why-do-academics-lean-left

Those findings are surprising! How could conservatives possibly make up 12% of the academy? They're certainly not in the humanities. And if they are, they better keep their mouths shout - see Noah Carl fiasco.

The taxpayer is basically being forced to subsidise a side in the culture war - that side being the left. We may as well start subsidising leftist think-tanks too.

A short description for my work :


As society today becomes more and more divided by political ideology, the time is now ripe that we systematically examine political systems at the level of their fundamental mechanics, in relation to their manifested effects in reality

By deriving solutions to the mechanical pitfalls within these political systems in question, we can finally craft a civilisation free from the unending cycle of boom and bust

My name is Eugene. Through personally testing out this solution both in my business and my life, I have found THE ONLY solution to the problem of Capitalism vs Communism and beyond, even down the the problem of politics itself

With this, we now finally have a fighting chance to mend this broken world back together !

1593177076,,Republican,Melinda Gates: Blacks and Native Americans Should Get Tested First For Corona
1593176668,"First I want to say I'm neither Republican nor Democrat. I hang out on this sub because I feel inundated by biased, liberal media and I want to hear the other side. I'm thoroughly disturbed by the liberal media's sustained attack against Trump and the liberals' unquestioning belief in their moral superiority, when the facts to me show that the Democratic party has no interest in helping the poor. 

The facts are that Bill Clinton, a Democrat, destroyed welfare as we knew it (TANF). He also ratified NAFTA which I consider one of the worst things to happen to working class America, period, though a lot of Americans don't seem to understand this. What did Obama do in his 8 years of presidency for the poor or black populations? He bailed out the banks and gifted health insurance companies with huge taxpayer subsidies and allowed premium hikes. His ""police reform"" took the form of 1-8 *hour* ""bias training"" classes that police departments could opt to take every *year* *or every 10 years**.* What? He drastically increased the number of H-1B visas which has the effect of forcing down middle class employees' wages through competition. In the 2008 financial crisis Americans received stimulus packages of, at most, $300 per adult. Yet under Trump we received $1200 per adult plus an additional $500 per child, and he gets nothing but contempt for not authorizing more. Trump also doubled the childcare tax credit, but somehow the media managed to drag that through the mud. I could go on and on, but I have no idea how the liberal media has so thoroughly managed to hoodwink Democrats into thinking their party represents the poor.  


Back to my original point, if anyone has read this far, is you can tell what party a small town is for just by how rundown it looks (and this is just my observation, not fact). I've driven all over the country, and no matter where I go, almost invariably, if it's a well-kept, wealthy looking little town you will see Democrat bumper stickers. And if it's a dump of a town where the people have obviously been forgotten, you see Republican bumper stickers and signs to ""vote"" everywhere. No wonder. Poor populations seem to be smart enough to understand that the Democrats just do not have their back.",Republican,You can tell by the town whether it's Red or Blue

1593038852,"Thinking realistically about how we think the country is going to vote.

Ignoring what any and all media tells us, it’s hard to say if Trump’s support has gone up or down since he won.

Also, Biden is MUCH less hated than Hillary was. Hillary was HATED, and if not for the email scandal...I think she would’ve won.

But we also have to consider what is happening in the country right now. The riots, the crime, Chaz, all that stuff. Will that push moderates or center people over to the right? In my mind, no rational, sane human being will see that and go “yeah...I want more of that. I’m gonna vote for more rioting, looting and cities being burned down”.  And historically, any time there has been rioting or anarchy, there has typically been a push back from the other side when it came to the next election. But hey, maybe I’m wrong, maybe the rioting has more supporters than I think.

What do you think? What do you honestly see happening?",Republican,Honestly...how do you see this election going?
